This for part 1 it is currently not working correctly. After hours (days) of debugging
I am fairly confident the problem stems from my previous assignment as the quaternions and splines 
are not being updated, but the current lib is not working and professor lane mentioned it may be because of the version of windows 
it was created on. I am hoping that with the updated one I will be able to get something working and resubmit in the future as suggested by Dr. Lane
